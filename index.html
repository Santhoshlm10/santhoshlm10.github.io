                    Bengaluru, India. Born in 1997, I hold a degree in Electronics and Communication from Gopalan
                    College of
                    Engineering (2015-2019).</p>
                <p> My journey with programming started during my pre-university days, but it was only when I discovered
                    its
                    real-world applications that I truly fell in love with it.
                    I wrote my first lines of code in Visual Basic, a language by Microsoft that introduced me to the
                    exciting world of software development. Since then, building meaningful and efficient software has
                    been
                    my driving force.</p>
